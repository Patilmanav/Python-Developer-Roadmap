# 🐍 The Python Developer Roadmap — by Manav

Welcome to my personal roadmap to becoming a **perfect Python developer**. This path is tailored to my journey as a backend developer working with Python, APIs, web scraping, and machine learning — while staying curious about IoT and other tech.

---

## ✅ Level 1: Polish the Core

> Strengthen the foundation to build anything.

- [ ] Master list, dict, set comprehensions
- [ ] Get comfortable with `with`, `yield`, `enumerate`, `zip`
- [ ] Understand mutable vs immutable types, and deep vs shallow copies
- [ ] Practice coding problems (LeetCode, HackerRank)

---

## 🧠 Level 2: Write Architect-Level Code

> Code that’s clean, scalable, and maintainable.

- [ ] Structure large projects using packages/modules
- [ ] Embrace OOP (favor composition over inheritance)
- [ ] Use `dataclasses`, `attrs`, and `pydantic`
- [ ] Add type hints and check with `mypy`

---

## 🚀 Level 3: API Framework Mastery

> Build robust, high-performance APIs.

- [ ] Deep dive into Flask (Blueprints, Middleware, Auth, Jinja2)
- [ ] Learn FastAPI (Async, Dependency Injection, Swagger docs)
- [ ] Implement background tasks and JWT authentication

---

## ⚡ Level 4: Async & Parallelism

> Speed up tasks with smart execution.

- [ ] Master `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, and `httpx`
- [ ] Use `threading`, `multiprocessing`, and `concurrent.futures`
- [ ] Apply `joblib` or `dask` for ML/data pipelines

---

## 🤖 Level 5: Automation & Scripting Pro

> Automate everything — save time, avoid repetition.

- [ ] Automate browsers with `selenium`, `playwright`
- [ ] Use `pyautogui` for GUI automation
- [ ] Manipulate files using `openpyxl`, `pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`
- [ ] Mix Bash and Python with `subprocess`

---

## 🔧 Level 6: IoT & Hardware Integration

> Bring Python into the real world.

- [ ] Control sensors and devices via Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Communicate with Arduino using serial communication
- [ ] Build basic IoT projects (e.g., motion-activated script runner)

---

## 🧪 Level 7: ML + Data Integration

> Use models the smart way, not the hard way.

- [ ] Use `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`
- [ ] Build clean data pipelines
- [ ] Integrate models like `face_recognition`, `mediapipe`, or YOLO
- [ ] Deploy ML models inside APIs

---

## 📦 Level 8: Packaging & Deployment

> Turn your scripts into shareable, deployable tools.

- [ ] Create and publish pip packages using `setuptools` / `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Deploy APIs using Railway, Vercel, or Docker + VPS
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

---

## 🌍 Level 9: Open Source & Reputation

> Share, contribute, and grow.

- [ ] Contribute to open-source Python projects
- [ ] Share useful tools, bots, and scripts on GitHub
- [ ] Write documentation, articles, or dev notes

---

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

This roadmap will evolve as I grow. My mission?  
**To master Python, build amazing things, and share knowledge.**  
Follow along, contribute, or fork it to start your own journey.

> Built with ☕, curiosity, and a lot of `print("debugging")`
