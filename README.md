# Python-Developer-Roadmap
LEVEL 1: Polish the Core (If not already)
You're probably solid here, but just to be sure:

 Master list/dict/set comprehensions

 Get comfortable with with, yield, enumerate, zip

 Understand Python memory model (mutable vs immutable, copy vs deepcopy)

 Practice tricky interview-style problems (LeetCode, HackerRank)

Goal: Feel like a ninja when solving logic problems.

LEVEL 2: Architect-Level Code
You’re building APIs, which is awesome — time to level up:

 Structure large Python projects with packages and modules

 Write clean OOP code (composition > inheritance)

 Use dataclasses, attrs, and pydantic

 Add type hints + check with mypy

Goal: Write clean, scalable, professional Python code like a backend boss.

LEVEL 3: Framework Mastery
Since you're into Flask and API building:

 Deep dive Flask (blueprints, middleware, Jinja2, auth)

 Learn FastAPI (if you haven’t) — async support is slick

 Add Swagger/OpenAPI auto docs

 Use background tasks, dependency injection, and JWT

Goal: Build lightning-fast APIs that feel like cheating.

LEVEL 4: Async & Parallel Processing
Great for scraping, ML, and performance-heavy tasks:

 Learn asyncio, aiohttp, and httpx

 Use concurrent.futures, threading, and multiprocessing

 Apply joblib or dask for ML/data workloads

Goal: Run like 10 scraping bots at once and laugh at rate limits.

LEVEL 5: Automation & Scripting Pro
Use Python as your robot butler:

 selenium, beautifulsoup4, playwright

 pyautogui for desktop automation

 openpyxl, pdfplumber, pyPDF2 for file manipulation

 Bash + Python scripts with subprocess

Goal: Automate the boring stuff — turn 3 hours of manual work into 2 lines of Python.

LEVEL 6: IoT & Hardware Integration
Because you’re curious about IoT:

 Use Python with Raspberry Pi (GPIO, camera, sensors)

 Connect Arduino to Python via serial

 Build a small project (e.g., motion-activated script runner)

Goal: Code that literally moves the world.

LEVEL 7: ML + Data Sidekick
If you're using pre-built models:

 Get comfy with scikit-learn, joblib, pandas

 Learn basic data pipelines and preprocessing

 Use face_recognition, mediapipe, or YOLO with Python

 Integrate models into APIs (you probably already are)

Goal: Deploy models like a mad scientist, but make it production-ready.

LEVEL 8: Packaging & Deployment
 Create your own pip package

 Use setuptools, pyproject.toml

 Learn to deploy on Railway, Vercel (for API+Next.js), or Docker + VPS

 Set up GitHub Actions for auto testing/deployment

Goal: Deploy code while sipping chai.

LEVEL 9: Open Source & Reputation
 Contribute to Python packages you use

 Share cool scripts or projects on GitHub

 Write short posts or docs to explain your projects

Goal: Let the world know: "This Manav guy knows his stuff."
